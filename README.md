# webcam-drawer | WIP

Little side project that allows you to draw on a web canvas via your webcam + index finger - for those who _don't have touchscreen PCs_ and are too lazy to draw on a tablet and transfer it.
Simply pinch your thumb and index finger to draw and separate to stop. Semi-transparent webcam feed in the background for drawing reference.

Current:
- Basic functionality - responsive drawing with finger + pinch tracking

Planned:
- Optimization - less jitter and more accuracy
- Customization with colors, sizes (perhaps finger responsive), and canvas clearing
- Drawing export with blank background
